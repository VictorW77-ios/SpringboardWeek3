My observations after updating the for-loop ranges to [-10,+10]:

-> Each iteration for '0' outputs -inf...-nan...+inf since any integer divided by zero results in -infinity to +infinity. 

-> Float integers allow for that huge range^

-> Unlike the output of range [1,10], where the table truncated -10/-4 = +2, the float int range [-10,+10] instead output the full value of -10/-4 = +2.500e+00
