For the Overflow Underflow exercise I noticed: 

-> 32-bit integers decrement to '-1' when initialized to 0, whether they're signed or unsigned. 

-> The signed 16-bit integer (s) incremented to the lowest possible range (-2^15), whereas the unsigned 16-bit integer (u) incremented to 0 - it's smallest possible value.
