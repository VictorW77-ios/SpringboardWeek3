These are my observations for the bit_values exercise: 
Toggling bit 3 ->  reduced the value of x by getting toggled to 0.  
Toggling bit 3 second time -> increased the value of x by being toggled back to 1. 
Clearing bit 7 -> reduced the value of x by 128. 
Clearing bits 16 - 31 -> reduced the value of x by a factor of 10^9 to 10^3. 
 


General Notes: 
-> Set bit: If Kth bit is 0, set to 1. If 1, leave it.  
-> Toggle bit: If Kth bit is 1, set to 0. If 0, set to 1. 
-> Clear bit: If Kth bit is 1, set to 0. If 0, leave it.
